<p><strong>Enhancing Decision Making Through the Integration of Large Language Models and Operations Research Optimization</strong><br>
<em>Segev Wasserkrug, Leonard Boussioux, Dick den Hertog, Farzaneh Mirzazadeh, Ş. Ilker Birbil, Jannis Kurtz, Donato Maragno</em><br>
<em>AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2025</em></p>
<p>Many critical business and societal decisions in areas such as supply chain and healthcare involve numerous potential actions, complex constraints, and goals that can be modeled as objective functions. Mathematical optimization, a core area in Operations Research (OR), provides robust, mathematically grounded methodologies to address such decisions and has shown tremendous benefits in many applications. However, its application requires the creation of accurate and efficient optimization models, necessitating rare expertise and considerable time, creating a barrier to widespread adoption in decision-making. Thus, it is a long-standing goal to make these capabilities widely accessible. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has made advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities widely accessible through natural language. LLMs can accelerate expert work in creating formal models like computer programs, and emerging research indicates they can also speed up the development of optimization models by OR experts. We, therefore, propose integrating and advancing LLM and optimization modeling to empower organizational decision-makers to model and solve such complex problems without requiring deep expertise in optimization. In this work, we present our vision for democratizing optimization modeling for organizational decision-making by such a combination of LLMs and optimization modeling. We identify a set of fundamental requirements for the vision&rsquo;s implementation and describe the state of the art through a literature survey and some experimentation. We show that a) LLMs already provide substantial novel capabilities relevant to realizing this vision, but that b) major research challenges remain to be addressed. We also propose possible research directions to overcome these gaps. We would like this work to serve as a call to action to bring together the LLM and OR optimization modeling communities to pursue this vision, thereby enabling much more widespread improved decision-making and increasing by orders of magnitude the benefits AI and OR can bring to enterprises and society.</p>

<p><strong>Output-Constrained Decision Trees</strong><br>
<em>Hüseyin Tunç, Doğanay Özese, Ş. İlker Birbil, Donato Maragno, Marco Caserta, Mustafa Baydoğan</em><br>
<em>arXiv preprint, 2025</em></p>
<p>Incorporating domain-specific constraints into machine learning models is essential for generating predictions that are both accurate and feasible in real-world applications. This paper introduces new methods for training Output-Constrained Regression Trees (OCRT), addressing the limitations of traditional decision trees in constrained multi-target regression tasks. We propose three approaches: M-OCRT, which uses split-based mixed integer programming to enforce constraints; E-OCRT, which employs an exhaustive search for optimal splits and solves constrained prediction problems at each decision node; and EP-OCRT, which applies post-hoc constrained optimization to tree predictions. To illustrate their potential uses in ensemble learning, we also introduce a random forest framework working under convex feasible sets. We validate the proposed methods through a computational study both on synthetic and industry-driven hierarchical time series datasets. Our results demonstrate that imposing constraints on decision tree training results in accurate and feasible predictions.</p>

<p><strong>Mixed-Integer Optimization with Constraint Learning</strong><br>
<em>Donato Maragno, Holly Wiberg, Dimitris Bertsimas, Ş. Ilker Birbil, Dick den Hertog, Adejuyigbe Fajemisin</em><br>
<em>Operations Research, 2025</em></p>
<p>We establish a broad methodological foundation for mixed-integer optimization with learned constraints.
We propose an end-to-end pipeline for data-driven decision making in which constraints and objectives are
directly learned from data using machine learning, and the trained models are embedded in an optimization
formulation. We exploit the mixed-integer optimization-representability of many machine learning methods,
including linear models, decision trees, ensembles, and multi-layer perceptrons, which allows us to capture
various underlying relationships between decisions, contextual variables, and outcomes. We also introduce
two approaches for handling the inherent uncertainty of learning from data. First, we characterize a decision
trust region using the convex hull of the observations, to ensure credible recommendations and avoid extrapolation. We efficiently incorporate this representation using column generation and propose a more flexible
formulation to deal with low-density regions and high-dimensional datasets. Then, we propose an ensemble
learning approach that enforces constraint satisfaction over multiple bootstrapped estimators or multiple
algorithms. In combination with domain-driven components, the embedded models and trust region define a
mixed-integer optimization problem for prescription generation. We implement this framework as a Python
package (OptiCL) for practitioners. We demonstrate the method in both World Food Programme planning
and chemotherapy optimization. The case studies illustrate the framework’s ability to generate high-quality
prescriptions as well as the value added by the trust region, the use of ensembles to control model robustness,
the consideration of multiple machine learning methods, and the inclusion of multiple learned constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Finding Regions of Counterfactual Explanations via Robust Optimization</strong><br>
<em>Donato Maragno, Jannis Kurtz, Tabea E. Röber, Rob Goedhart, Ş. Ilker Birbil, Dick den Hertog</em><br>
<em>INFORMS Journal on Computing, 2024 (INFORMS)</em></p>
<p>Counterfactual explanations play an important role in detecting bias and improving the explainability of
data-driven classification models. A counterfactual explanation (CE) is a minimal perturbed data point for
which the decision of the model changes. Most of the existing methods can only provide one CE, which may
not be achievable for the user. In this work we derive an iterative method to calculate robust CEs, i.e.,
CEs that remain valid even after the features are slightly perturbed. To this end, our method provides a
whole region of CEs allowing the user to choose a suitable recourse to obtain a desired outcome. We use
algorithmic ideas from robust optimization and prove convergence results for the most common machine
learning methods including decision trees, tree ensembles, and neural networks. Our experiments show that
our method can efficiently generate globally optimal robust CEs for a variety of common data sets and
classification models.</p>
