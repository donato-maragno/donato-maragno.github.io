<h1 id="what-is-inventory-management-and-why-does-it-matter">What is inventory management, and why does it matter?<a href="#what-is-inventory-management-and-why-does-it-matter" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>At its core, inventory management is the art, and often the headache, of ensuring that the right product is available in the right place, at the right time, and at the right cost. Sounds simple, but in practice it’s one of the most complex problems in operations, especially when the number of products is large, the supply chain has multiple levels, and the costs structure has several components.
On the one hand, organizations want to keep inventories lean: holding too much stock ties up capital, increases storage costs, and risks obsolescence. On the other hand, running too lean can mean lost sales, production delays, and unsatisfied customers. The sweet spot lies somewhere in between, and finding it consistently is the challenge.</p>
<h2 id="some-notation-before-continuing">Some notation before continuing<a href="#some-notation-before-continuing" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>To understand inventory management, it helps to agree on some basic terms. These are the building blocks of most models and policies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Policy</strong>: The rule that governs ordering decisions: when to order and how much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Level</strong>: The ability to meet customer demand without running out of stock. It can have more specific definitions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>cycle service level</em>: <em>the probability of not stocking out between one replenishment and the next</em>.</li>
<li><em>Fill rate</em>: the fraction of demand that can be met immediately from inventory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead Time</strong>: The time between placing an order and receiving it. Lead time can be stable (e.g., always 5 days) or highly variable (sometimes 2 days, sometimes 12), and this uncertainty has a big impact on how much safety stock you need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety Stock</strong>: Extra inventory held as a buffer against uncertainty in demand or lead time. Think of it as an insurance: the more volatile your environment, the more safety stock you may need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Backorder vs. Lost Sale</strong>: When demand cannot be met:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Backorder</em>: you promise to deliver later.</li>
<li><em>Lost Sale</em>: the customer walks away, and the revenue is gone for good.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Holding Cost</strong>: The cost of keeping stock. This includes more than just warehouse rent: tied-up capital, insurance, depreciation, spoilage, and obsolescence all count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ordering Cost</strong>: The fixed cost incurred every time you place an order, regardless of size (administration, setup, paperwork, logistics). This is why large, infrequent orders can be attractive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stockout (or Shortage) Cost</strong>: The cost of not having inventory when needed. This can be explicit (penalties, expediting fees) or implicit (lost sales, unhappy customers, reputational damage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capacity</strong>: Practical limits such as storage space, supplier production limits, or transport bottlenecks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Multi-Echelon Inventory</strong>: When stock is spread across multiple layers of a network (plants, central warehouses, regional depots, retail stores). Managing them in isolation leads to inefficiencies; managing them as a system unlocks savings and higher service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="a-policy-is-all-you-need">A policy is all you need<a href="#a-policy-is-all-you-need" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h5>
<p>Whether we’re talking about spare parts for an airline, fast-moving goods in a supermarket, or raw materials for a manufacturer, what differentiate inventory systems from each others is the adopted reordering policy.
Inventory management without policies is like playing chess without knowing how the pieces move, every decision feels ad hoc. Policies provide structure. They translate abstract objectives (like “keep service level above 95%” or “minimize holding cost”) into operational rules that can be executed day to day.</p>
<p>Some policies among the most used ones are:</p>
<h6 id="s-q-reorder-point--fixed-order-quantity-policy">(s, Q) Reorder Point / Fixed Order Quantity Policy<a href="#s-q-reorder-point--fixed-order-quantity-policy" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When stock drops to a <strong>reorder point (s)</strong>, place an order of a <strong>fixed quantity (Q)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Items with stable demand or critical items where stockouts are costly.</li>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> The order size never changes.</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simple to calculate; ensures a buffer against stockouts.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires continuous inventory monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>s = 21 units, Q = 50 units</li>
<li>Current inventory drops to 20 → order 50 units → new inventory = 70</li>
<li>Current inventory drops to 10 → order 50 units → new inventory = 60</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="s-s-policy">(s, S) Policy<a href="#s-s-policy" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works:</strong>
<ul>
<li>When inventory falls to <strong>s</strong>, order enough to raise stock to <strong>S</strong>.</li>
<li>Order quantity varies depending on current inventory level.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Items with variable demand.</li>
<li><strong>Implication:</strong> The order quantity <strong>varies depending on current stock</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Flexible; reduces risk of overstocking.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> More complex than fixed-order policies and requires continuous inventory monitoring.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong>
<ul>
<li>s = 21 units, S = 70 units</li>
<li>Current inventory drops to 20 → order 50 units → new inventory = 70</li>
<li>Current inventory drops to 10 → order 60 units → new inventory = 70</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h6 id="periodic-review-p-q-policy">Periodic Review (P, Q) Policy<a href="#periodic-review-p-q-policy" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h6>
<ul>
<li><strong>How it works:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Inventory is checked at <strong>fixed intervals</strong> (e.g., weekly, monthly).</li>
<li>If inventory is below a target, place an order of a <strong>fixed quantity (Q)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Best for:</strong> Items where continuous monitoring is costly or less critical.</li>
<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Simplifies monitoring and ordering schedules.</li>
<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires larger safety stock to cover intervals between reviews.</li>
<li><strong>Example:</strong><br>
- Review period P = 1 week, Q = 50, safety stock = 40.
- Inventory on review day = 30 → order 50 → new inventory = 80.<br>
- If demand consumes 70 units in the week, next order waits until the following review day, possibly requiring safety stock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each policy comes with strengths and blind spots. A simple reorder point policy may work well in stable environments but break down when variability spikes. Conversely, more sophisticated dynamic policies require stronger data and computational support.</p>
<p>The real art lies not just in picking a policy, but in optimizing its parameters. The difference between a reorder point of 50 units vs. 55 can mean thousands of euros in holding cost or service penalties over a year. That’s why optimization models are often tasked with finding these values, rather than leaving them to gut feeling.</p>
<h2 id="uncertainty-the-ever-present-wild-card">Uncertainty: the ever-present wild card<a href="#uncertainty-the-ever-present-wild-card" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h2>
<p>If policies are the rules of the game, uncertainty is the opponent that refuses to play fair. It’s the defining feature of inventory problems, what makes them fascinating, frustrating, and financially critical. Let´s see where uncertainty might appear, but I will write another post deep diving into it.</p>
<p><strong>Demand variability</strong> is the most obvious source. Forecasts, no matter how advanced, are imperfect. Promotions can double demand overnight. A single customer order might dwarf the “average” week in industries like heavy machinery or aerospace.
Then there’s <strong>supply-side uncertainty</strong>. Lead times are rarely constant. A supplier might deliver in 5 days on average, but sometimes it’s 2, sometimes 12. Add in risks like port congestion, strikes, or geopolitical shocks, and suddenly the neat numbers in your planning file look less reassuring.
And don’t forget <strong>internal uncertainty</strong>, production lines that break down, IT systems that hiccup, or simply human error in recording transactions.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to respond to it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Safety stock</strong>: paying an insurance premium in the form of extra inventory.</li>
<li><strong>Network flexibility</strong>: dual sourcing or dynamic reallocation between warehouses.
Both of them aim at increasing robustness in the inventory management system.</li>
</ul>
<p>From a mathematical perspective, uncertainty is what turns a simple deterministic model into a rich stochastic or robust optimization problem, and I love it. Instead of asking, <em>“What’s the optimal order if demand next week is 100 units?”</em>, the real question should be, <em>“What’s the policy that works best across hundreds of possible futures?”</em>. But again, this is for another post. Now let´s continue with the <em>easier</em> deterministic assumption.</p>
<p>In the <a href="/posts/inventory-management-part-2/">next post</a>, we will see how to use mathematical optimization to find an optimal <em>(s, S)</em> policy under no uncertainty.</p>
